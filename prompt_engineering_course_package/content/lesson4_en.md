# Interactive Lesson 4: Advanced Prompt Techniques

## Learning Objectives

- Solve complex tasks through prompts
- Iteratively improve prompts

## Introduction

Welcome to the fourth lesson of our Prompt Engineering course! In this lesson, we will explore advanced prompt techniques that are particularly useful for solving complex tasks and further improving the quality of responses from Gemini.

## Chain-of-Thought Prompting

Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting is a technique where the model is encouraged to lay out its thinking process step by step before arriving at a final answer. This is particularly useful for complex tasks that require multiple steps of reasoning.

### How Does Chain-of-Thought Prompting Work?

With this technique, you explicitly ask the model to think "step by step" or explain its reasoning process.

**Example:**
```
Analyze the following security incident and explain step by step how you would proceed:

An employee reports that their computer is running unusually slowly and displaying strange pop-ups. Additionally, a large file transfer to an unknown external IP address was detected in the firewall logs.

Think through the incident step by step and develop an investigation plan.
```

### Benefits of Chain-of-Thought Prompting

1. **Transparency**: You can follow the model's thinking process
2. **Accuracy**: The model makes fewer errors on complex tasks
3. **Traceability**: The answer is better documented and verifiable
4. **Learning effect**: Team members can learn from the demonstrated thought process

### Example for SOC Applications

**Prompt:**
```
You are an experienced SOC analyst. Analyze the following events and explain step by step whether they might be related and represent a coordinated attack:

1. 10:15 AM - Multiple failed login attempts for the admin account "sysadmin" from IP 203.0.113.42
2. 10:23 AM - Successful login for the account "jsmith" from IP 203.0.113.42
3. 10:31 AM - PowerShell command to disable Windows Defender on "jsmith's" computer
4. 10:42 AM - Unusual outbound connection from "jsmith's" computer to IP 198.51.100.73 on port 4444

Think through the events step by step and explain your analysis.
```

## Role-Based Prompts

With role-based prompts, you assign the model a specific role to assume when responding. This can significantly improve the quality and relevance of the answers, especially for domain-specific tasks.

### How Do Role-Based Prompts Work?

You start the prompt with a clear role assignment that tells the model from which perspective it should respond.

**Example:**
```
You are a Threat Intelligence Analyst with 10 years of experience investigating APT groups. Analyze the following indicators and identify possible threat actor groups that might be behind them.
```

### Effective Roles for SOC Tasks

1. **SOC Analyst**: For general security analysis and incident response
2. **Threat Hunter**: For proactive threat searching
3. **Malware Analyst**: For analyzing malicious software
4. **Forensic Investigator**: For detailed post-incident investigations
5. **Security Architect**: For security architecture recommendations
6. **Compliance Specialist**: For questions about regulations and standards

### Example for Role-Based Prompts in SOC

**Prompt:**
```
You are a Malware Analyst specializing in ransomware. A user has opened a suspicious email attachment, and shortly after, unusual activities were detected on their computer. The following indicators were observed:

- New processes: svchost.exe started from an unusual path
- Network connections to IP 185.212.x.x on port 443
- Changes to the Windows registry under HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
- New files with the .encrypted extension in multiple directories

Analyze these indicators, identify the possible ransomware family, and recommend immediate containment measures.
```

## Requesting Structured Output Formats

Another advanced technique is to request specific output formats. This is particularly useful when you need the answers in a certain format or when you want to process the answers further.

### Common Output Formats

1. **Lists**: For clear enumerations
2. **Tables**: For comparing data
3. **JSON/XML**: For processing in scripts
4. **Markdown**: For formatted documentation
5. **YAML**: For configuration files

### Example for Structured Output Formats

**Prompt:**
```
You are a SOC analyst. Based on the following events, create an incident report in JSON format with the fields: incident_id, severity (high, medium, low), affected_systems (array), indicators_of_compromise (array), recommended_actions (array), and summary (text).

Events:
1. Multiple failed login attempts for various user accounts from IP 198.51.100.42
2. Successful login for the account "jdoe" from the same IP
3. Unusual PowerShell commands on "jdoe's" computer
4. Connection to a known C2 domain from this computer
```

## Iteratively Improving Prompts

One of the most important advanced techniques is the iterative improvement of prompts. This involves analyzing the responses received and adjusting your prompts accordingly to achieve better results.

### Steps for Iterative Improvement

1. **Analyze**: Evaluate the response received
2. **Identify**: Find problems or opportunities for improvement
3. **Adjust**: Modify the prompt accordingly
4. **Test**: Try out the new prompt
5. **Repeat**: Go through the process again if needed

### Example for Iterative Improvement

**Original Prompt:**
```
Create a phishing detection checklist.
```

**Response:** *Too general, not SOC-specific*

**Improved Prompt:**
```
You are a SOC analyst. Create a checklist for detecting phishing emails for our security team.
```

**Response:** *Better, but still not structured enough*

**Further Improved Prompt:**
```
You are a SOC analyst specializing in email security. Create a detailed checklist for detecting phishing emails for our security team. The checklist should:

1. Be divided into categories (sender, content, links, attachments)
2. Include both technical and non-technical indicators
3. Have a rating scale for each item (high, medium, low)
4. Include concrete examples for each indicator
5. Include recommended actions when phishing is suspected

Format the checklist clearly using Markdown.
```

## Practical Exercise: Advanced Prompt Techniques

Let's apply some advanced prompt techniques for SOC tasks:

1. Create a chain-of-thought prompt for analyzing suspicious network traffic.
2. Formulate a role-based prompt for recommendations on improving endpoint security.
3. Develop a prompt that requests a structured JSON output for a security incident.

## Challenge: Chain-of-Thought Prompt for Threat Hunting

**Task:**

Develop a comprehensive chain-of-thought prompt for a Gemini model to help your SOC team with a threat hunting scenario. The prompt should:

1. Include a clear role assignment for the model
2. Describe a realistic threat hunting scenario
3. Instruct the model to lay out its thinking process step by step
4. Include specific data or indicators to be analyzed
5. Request a structured output for the results

Remember to use SOC-specific terminology and realistic data to make the prompt practical.

## Summary

In this lesson, we have learned:
- How chain-of-thought prompting can be used for complex analysis tasks
- How role-based prompts improve the quality and relevance of responses
- How to request specific output formats to facilitate further processing
- How to iteratively improve prompts to achieve optimal results

In the next lesson, we will focus on prompt engineering specifically for security analysis and learn how to effectively use Gemini for SOC tasks.
